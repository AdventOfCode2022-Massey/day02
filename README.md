# Advent of Code 2022: Day 2
Ben and Bart Massey

---

As with Day 1, we hassled around a bit with the input
processing.

We wrote separate solutions: the `main` branch contains
Ben's, with a few of my modifications. It's a little "brute
forcey" but very simple to understand if you get the math
right. The branch `bart-soln` contains Bart's, which is a
little cleaner but maybe less clear.
